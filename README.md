# VirtualEarth-master
Platform to host 3D outcrop models from around the world

Currently this is a little rough, but wanted to get some of the code up to Github sooner rather than later. It includes
most of the HoloToolkit so that could be removed for future uploads.

This set of codes is the bare bones to run the Virtual Earth application on the HoloLens. The application allows for the
downloading and displaying of 3 dimensional holographic outcrops in 1:1 scale (and scaled if needed). The outcrop models
are stored on an external server as asset bundles and downloaded as needed.
